This project has been developed solely for educational and personal learning purposes. It does not intend to violate the terms and conditions of Amazon.com or any other website.
I do not encourage or endorse the use of web scraping tools, bots, or scripts to extract private, personal, or restricted data from any websiteâ€”including publicly available data, unless explicitly permitted by the site's terms of service.
This project does not include any search or indexing functionality, nor does it print or store any scraped data.
Users are advised to refer to and respect the robots.txt file and terms of service of any site they interact with.
If you choose to test this project, please ensure that the target website allows scraping for educational or public purposes.
Numerous public demonstrations (e.g., YouTube tutorials) may show scraping on platforms like Amazon.in, but I do not promote or support such activities unless legally and ethically allowed.
